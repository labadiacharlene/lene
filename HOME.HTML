<p><i> One of the most popular waterfalls in the country, Kawasan Falls is a multi-tier falls found at the foot of Mantalongan Mountain Range in Badian, Cebu.
  The waterfalls are picture-perfect with the lush greenery and natural pools where people can take a refreshing dip into the cool turquoise water. 
  Considering that the waterfalls are found amidst the forest, an uphill hike is necessary to reach the first waterfall which is also the largest and usually crowded among the three-layer falls. 
  Aside from swimming, canyoneering is also a popular activity done in the area.</i></p>
